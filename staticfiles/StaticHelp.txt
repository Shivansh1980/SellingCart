1.Static Files are css files , images , javascript files that we can save in browser but during production we didnt let django 
  to save our file instead we use AWS

2.Go in urls of base Directory First

3.Now there you need to import staticfiles_urlpatterns from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls
  and then add following line -->

  urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()


4.Now Go to settings.py there at last you will see the following line
        STATIC_URL = '/static/'

    This is the address that tells django that there you need to go to find your static Files
    For Ex: 1.if you want to find the style.css in the static files directory then what you need to write in the url of 
              browser is localhost:port/static/app_name/style.css or localhost:port/static/style.css 

            2. now suppose you changed the url STATIC_URL = '/assets/' then in url instead of localhost:port/static/style.css
               you will write localhost:port/assets/style.css


5.Now since django dont know that where you have this static directory so you need to tell django this by using the code : 

        STATIC_DIR = {
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assests')
        }

    This means there is folder named assests where you are going to put your static files and that folder is located just one above 
    the Base_Dir(main directory that contains settings.py)

    Note : in our project instead of assests we named that folder media

6.Now the point is since we have now our static files(style.css) in our assets directory then how we can connect it to our templates 
    we can do it by just giving the path of our static files in our template :

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">

    this is the hardcoding method i.e. suppose due to somereason you have changed 
    Static_url from static to assest then you need to change the path in every template.
    to avoid it we have another method using jinja coding as given below

7.Write in template in begining {%load static from staticfiles%}
  now instead of providing url in href we can write
  href = "{% static 'style.css' %}"
