<------------- MEDIA MOST IMPORTANT ------------>

1.To upload media we need to add two things in the settings.py as we did for static files (refer to statichelp in the static directory to know about this)

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')

2.Now this will create the media folder inside our outer SellingCart directory
So this media root will upload whatever we want to upload and then 
django can fetch that data from the media_url

3.Now go in urls.py and type there :

    (1)from django.conf import settings
    # now we have now access to those two properties that we defined in settings
    (2)urlpattern += static(MEDIA_URL,document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

    By this django will know where media files are available from url that we will type onto the browser which can we done in our template as :

        <img src="{{article.thumb.url}}">

        Where thumb is the ImageField(default="default.png") in models.py and articles is class in models.py
